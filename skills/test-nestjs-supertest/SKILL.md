  Write API integration tests for NestJS applications using Supertest to validate the full request/response cycle: routing, middleware, guards, pipes, interceptors, and database interactions, without a browser or UI.
  Use it to scaffold integration test suites, test CRUD endpoints, verify authenticated/protected routes, and isolate the test database between runs.

  WHEN TO USE: Setting up `supertest` with NestJS and Jest, writing `*.e2e-spec.ts` files, testing POST/GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints against a running `INestApplication`, testing routes protected by guards (JWT/Bearer auth), configuring `Test.createTestingModule` + `createNestApplication()`, or isolating/cleaning a test database between tests.

  DO NOT USE FOR: unit tests of controllers/services/providers in isolation, frontend component tests, or true browser E2E tests that simulate real user interactions through a UI (use the `playwright`/`cypress` skills instead).

# NestJS Supertest API Integration Testing

## Overview

Tests in this skill use Supertest to make real HTTP requests against a
running `INestApplication` instance, exercising the complete
request/response cycle — middleware, guards, pipes, interceptors, and
database interactions — without needing a browser or UI.

**Capabilities:**
- Scaffold API integration test suites with `Test.createTestingModule` + `createNestApplication()`.
- Test CRUD endpoints (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE), including validation error responses.
- Verify authenticated / protected routes guarded by JWT/Bearer auth.
- Isolate and clean the test database between runs.

**Limitations:**
- Not for unit tests of controllers/services/providers in isolation.
- Not for frontend component tests.
- Not for true browser E2E tests that simulate real user interactions through a UI (use the `playwright`/`cypress` skills instead).

> **Note:** NestJS docs and tooling conventionally call these "E2E tests"
> and name the files `*.e2e-spec.ts`, but technically they are **API
> integration tests**: unlike true E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright), they
> don't drive a UI or simulate real user interactions. This skill keeps
> `*.e2e-spec.ts` filenames because Jest's e2e test discovery config
> (`test/jest-e2e.json`) matches that pattern — renaming them would break
> test discovery in a real NestJS project.
>
> **Naming note:** the code examples below use `(API integration)` instead
> of the `(e2e)` label that appears in NestJS's own documentation. This is
> intentional, to reinforce that these are technically API integration
> tests, not end-to-end tests with a UI. The string inside `describe(...)`
> is purely a human-readable label for test reports — it has zero effect on
> test behavior — so if you prefer to follow NestJS's convention, you can
> rename it back to `(e2e)` without affecting functionality.

## Prerequisites

- A NestJS application with `@nestjs/testing`, `jest` and `supertest` installed.
- Jest e2e config present (`test/jest-e2e.json`) matching the `*.e2e-spec.ts` pattern.
- A test database (or isolation strategy) available for integration runs.

## Examples

Full, self-contained spec files demonstrating the patterns above:

| File | Demonstrates |
|------|--------------|
| `examples/users.e2e-spec.ts` | Complete Users resource spec: CRUD (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) plus protected-route authentication in one file |
| `examples/orders.e2e-spec.ts` | Spec with full database isolation: `synchronize(true)` reset between tests, with assertions proving isolation actually works |

> These files are only loaded if the agent needs additional context.
